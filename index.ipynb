    "Currently we have looked at Random Forest Classifiers ( scikit-learn ) implementation but the idea can easily be extended to GBDT. Currently the package implements the `Approximate Evasion` method implemented in the paper. For experimental evaluation we look at `MNIST` digit classification dataset with only two categories `2` and `6`. The paper also chooses this dataset because it is well studied datasets, one-to-one mapping between pixels and features and features can vary independently of each other. We can pictorially represent evading instances, and this helps understanding the models’ robustness or lack of."

    "As the paper mentions, we expect a high performance learning algorithm to generalize well and be hard to evade: only a “large enough” perturbation δ should be able to alter its decision. The existence of small-δ evading instances shows a defect in the generalization ability of the model, and hints at improper model class and/or insufficient regularization. \n",
